# 1.Tutorial
- This Starter Kit to React-Redux-Webpack is based on Kurt's tutorial video on Youtube
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQDnxXqV213JJFtDaG0aE9vqvp6Wm7nBg
- After you are familiar with Redux+React, and how to use webpack to bundle your JSX files, you can take a look at /components/react-redux-initer-example.
- <a>Initer.js</a> is a repackage of React+Redux, to simplify complexity and modularize a React component with its corresponding Redux reducer/actions.
- Start playing around with it, and hopefully we can talk more about this for next meeting.
